# webScrapeMyOwnSite

## Extract my data from my web site using python and put those data into a csv file.
In this repo, I use the following python libraries/modules:
  ##### requests ==> to make my get request
  ##### BeautifulSoup ==> pulling data out of the HTML 
  ##### pandas ==> use the dataframe to display the data

Use Jupter Notebook to run my code (dataframe looks much nicer using Jupter Notebook)
